 <p>
 I am a third year PhD student in the Computer Science Department (CICS) at University of Massachusetts Amherst. 
 I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~arya/">Arya Mazumdar</a>.  
Prior to this I graduated from <a href="http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur</a> in August 2016 with a Bachelors
degree in Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering. 
   
<h3> Research</h3>

''What is unseen, is not necessarily unknown'' - Wendelessen

  <p>My research interests are statistical machine learning, information theory and coding theory. I have worked on problems related to random graph theory, high dimensional integration and semi-supervised clustering.
    Recently, I am interested in the interesting traces reconstruction problem and other problems corresponding to the random deletion channel.

<i>The AAAI proceeding version contains some errors that have since been corrected in the above revised version in arXiv. Namely, in the Geometric Block Model, given two vertices connected by an edge, the events of other vertices being a common neighbor of both are not independent events (unlike the stochastic block model). Please refer to the arXiv version linked above for corrected statements and results.</i>  </p>
